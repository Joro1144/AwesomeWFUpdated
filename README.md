## Software
### Mod Loaders
  - [R2modman](https://r2modman.net) Ah r2m! The famous open source option for those with all types of devices to get mods from Thunderstore, including the Steam Deck!
  - [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/) Of course, Thunderstore has their own mod loader, but do you want ads while you try to install mods? ðŸ˜‚
  - [Buoy: The Hook, Line and Sinker fork](https://github.com/FerretPaws/Buoy) - Previously HLS, then HLS Rewritten, and now Buoy. (All of which made by different people.)
  - [Gale](https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale) - Pretty lightweight and not that known for a smaller and open source mod loader.
  - [Rod n' Mod](https://github.com/nyxical420/rodnmod) - Thematic and open source mod loader with the vibes of Webfishing when installing mods!

### Dedicated Servers
  - [Cove](https://github.com/DrMeepso/WebFishingCove) - Made in C#, this server software is well known for being "lightweight and fast..[running] with less than 1gb of ram with 20+ players on the server!"
     - [Cove's Plugin Template](https://github.com/DrMeepso/TemplateCovePlugin) - Cove does support plugins, if you do wish to add some.
  - [Fishy](https://github.com/ncrypted-dev/Fishy) - Inspired by Cove and also made with C#, this also can be a option for you. But be wary it is in beta.
  - [Baiters](https://github.com/DanielMcAssey/baiters-server) - C# as usual, has plugin support and a very different UI when managing the server.

--------------------

## MIDI Tools
  - [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) - MIDI channel creator typically used with music software, and but in this case, WEBFISHING. Simply install loopMIDI and restart your PC right after.

Most MIDI player software requires that you have an open channel with loopMIDI. To play a song in-game, open the guitar menu, and depending on which program you installed to play MIDIs, given you installed the [MidiStrummer](https://github.com/puppy-girl/MidiStrummer) mod to your mod list, you should be good to go!

### Players
  - [WEBFISHING Guitar](https://webfishing-guitar.com/) - The community-run MIDI player made specifically for WEBFISHING.
  - [KevAquila's Guitar Player](https://github.com/KevAquila/WEBFISHING-Guitar-Player/) - Play MIDIs on WEBFISHING **without needing to mod your game, or setup loopMIDI**! (Useful if you want a vanilla like experience. However this locks your mouse to the window!)w
  - [Bard Music Player](https://bardmusicplayer.com) - A MIDI player that has a simple UI, and has their song repository built in to the app.
  - [NanoMIDI Player](https://github.com/NotHammer043/nanoMIDIPlayer) - Simple, easy to use and configure MIDI player.
  - [Signal MIDI Player](https://signal.vercel.app/edit) - A MIDI player that runs completely in your browser using webMIDI.

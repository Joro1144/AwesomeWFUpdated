## Software
### Mod Loaders
  - [R2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus) - Ah r2m! The famous open source option for those with all types of devices to get mods from Thunderstore, including the Steam Deck!
  - [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/) - Of course, Thunderstore has their own mod loader, but do you want ads while you try to install mods?
  - [Buoy: The Hook, Line and Sinker fork](https://github.com/FerretPaws/Buoy) - Previously HLS, then HLS Rewritten, and now Buoy. (All of which made by different people.)
  - [Gale](https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale) - Pretty lightweight and not that known for a smaller and open source mod loader.
  - [Rod n' Mod](https://github.com/nyxical420/rodnmod) - Thematic and open source mod loader with the vibes of Webfishing when installing mods!

### Dedicated Servers
  - [Cove](https://github.com/DrMeepso/WebFishingCove) - Made in C#, this server software is well known for being "lightweight and fast..[running] with less than 1gb of ram with 20+ players on the server!"
     - [Cove's Plugin Template](https://github.com/DrMeepso/TemplateCovePlugin) - Cove does support plugins, if you do wish to add some.
  - [Fishy](https://github.com/ncrypted-dev/Fishy) - Inspired by Cove and also made with C#, this also can be a option for you. But be wary it is in beta.
  - [Baiters](https://github.com/DanielMcAssey/baiters-server) - C# as usual, has plugin support and a very different UI when managing the server.
  - [Ducky](https://github.com/tma02/ducky) - Written in Rust, this is another option with a config to run the server.

--------------------

### MIDI Tools
  - [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) - MIDI channel creator typically used with music software, and but in this case, WEBFISHING. Simply install loopMIDI and restart your PC right after.
  > Most MIDI player software for Webfishing requires that you have an open channel with loopMIDI. To play a song in-game, open the guitar menu, and depending on which program you installed to play MIDIs, given you installed the [MidiStrummer](https://github.com/puppy-girl/MidiStrummer) mod to your mod list, you should be good to go!

## Players
  - [WEBFISHING Guitar](https://webfishing-guitar.com/) - The community-run MIDI player made specifically for WEBFISHING.
  - [KevAquila's Guitar Player](https://github.com/KevAquila/WEBFISHING-Guitar-Player/) - Play MIDIs on WEBFISHING **without needing to mod your game, or setup loopMIDI**! (Useful if you want a vanilla like experience. However this locks your mouse to the window!)
  - [Bard Music Player](https://bardmusicplayer.com) - A MIDI player that has a simple UI, and has their song repository built in to the app.
  - [NanoMIDI Player](https://github.com/NotHammer043/nanoMIDIPlayer) - Simple, easy to use and configure MIDI player.
  - [Signal MIDI Player](https://signal.vercel.app/edit) - A MIDI player that runs completely in your browser using webMIDI.

### Editors
  - [WEBFISHING Guitar Sequencer](https://sequencer.webfishing-guitar.com/) - Create and upload MIDI's and edit them for WEBFISHING.
